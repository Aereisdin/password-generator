## Created to help secure your password protected data
This is a password generator that uses prompts to gather information to format and create a random password for the user.

## Workflow of the Application
1. When the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button the script will generate a series of prompts to assist the user in customizing their desired password.

2. The first prompt asks the user to select a number between 8 and 128.

3. The next series of prompts alerts the user that lower case letters will be used by default and then asks if they would like to add capital letters, numbers and/or symbols.

4. Once the user has navigated through the customization prompts and confirmations, the password will be generated in the open field above the button.

5. If the user wishes to generate another password, they can click the button and follow the series of prompts to create a new random password. The old one will be cleared out.
